# Hello, I'm Juditha

Actively building technical skills through hands-on learning and project-based experience. Seeking an internship opportunity in either the IT or cybersecurity field to apply my growing knowledge in a real-world professional environment.
I am committed to continuous learning and eager to work alongside experienced professionals who can mentor me as I develop practical skills in areas such as system administration, network security, and threat detection. I bring enthusiasm, strong problem-solving abilities, and a genuine desire to contribute to a team while gaining the hands-on experience necessary to build a successful future in technology.
